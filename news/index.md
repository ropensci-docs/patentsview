# Changelog

## patentsview 1.0.0

CRAN release: 2026-02-26

#### Breaking changes

- **API key required**: The new API requires authentication. Request a
  key at
  <https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals>
  and set `PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **Endpoint changes**: Now 27 endpoints (up from 7). Endpoints are
  singular (e.g., `patent` not `patents`). The `nber_subcategory`
  endpoint was removed; `cpc_subsection` is now `cpc_group`.

- **Field changes**: `patent_number` is now `patent_id`. Raw inventor
  name fields (`rawinventor_first_name`, `rawinventor_last_name`) were
  removed. Some fields are now nested and require full qualification in
  queries (e.g., `cpc_current.cpc_group_id`).

- **Paging parameters changed**: `per_page`/`page` replaced by
  `size`/`after`. Maximum `size` is 1,000 (was 10,000). Result sets are
  now unbounded (was capped at 100,000).

- **httr to httr2 migration**: If you passed
  `config = httr::timeout(40)`, now use `timeout = 40` directly.

- **`cast_pv_data()` removed**: The API now returns proper types
  (boolean, numeric, etc.) instead of strings.

#### New features

- [`retrieve_linked_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/retrieve_linked_data.md)
  fetches data from HATEOAS links returned by the API
- All fields are now queryable (previously some fields could only be
  returned, not queried)
- Group name shorthand for fields: `fields = "assignees"` returns all
  assignee fields
- API throttling handled automatically (45 requests/minute limit)

#### New vignettes

- “API Changes” - comprehensive guide to migrating from the old API
- “Converting an Existing Script” - practical migration examples
- “Result Set Paging” - explains new paging mechanism
- “Understanding the API” - converted from PatentsView’s Jupyter
  notebook

#### Internal

- Tests now use vcr for HTTP mocking, improving speed and reliability
- [`unnest_pv_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/unnest_pv_data.md)
  handles empty API results without crashing
- Paging structure mismatch now throws an error instead of warning
  (prevents confusing `rbind` failures)
- Live API tests skip by default; enable with
  `PATENTSVIEW_LIVE_TESTS=true`

## patentsview 0.3.0 (2021-09-03)

##### Misc

- The package is now using the new HTTPS endpoints
  ([\#17](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/issues/17))

- [`with_qfuns()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/with_qfuns.md)
  now find objects in the calling environment
  ([@jcheng5](https://github.com/jcheng5),
  [\#20](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/issues/20))
- Vignettes are being pre-computed
  ([\#23](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/issues/23))
- An issue was fixed where query strings weren’t being properly
  URL-encoded
  ([\#24](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/issues/24))
- Adhoc logic was added to handle API throttling

## patentsview 0.2.2 (2019-01-23)

CRAN release: 2019-01-28

##### Misc

- Vignettes removed from package so that CRAN builds don’t fail when API
  is down

## patentsview 0.2.1 (2018-03-05)

CRAN release: 2018-03-14

##### Misc

- Examples that hit the API were wrapped in `\dontrun{}` so CRAN doesn’t
  request fixes to package when API is down

## patentsview 0.2.0 (2018-02-08)

CRAN release: 2018-02-09

##### New features

- `cast_pv_data()` function added to convert the data types of the data
  returned by
  [`search_pv()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/search_pv.md)
- Additional fields added to the API (e.g., fields starting with
  `forprior_`, `examiner_`)

##### Misc

- Additional error handler added for the locations endpoint
  ([@mustberuss](https://github.com/mustberuss),
  [\#11](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/issues/11))
- `error_browser` option has been deprecated

## patentsview 0.1.0 (2017-05-01)

CRAN release: 2017-07-12

##### New functions

- `search_pv` added to send requests to the PatentsView API
- `qry_funs` list added with functions to help users write queries
- `get_fields` and `get_endpoints` added to quickly get possible field
  names and endpoints, respectively
- `unnest_pv_data` added to unnest the data frames in the returned data
