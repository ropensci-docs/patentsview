## Why care about patents?

**1. Patents play a critical role in incentivizing innovation, without
which we wouldn’t have much of the technology we rely on everyday**

What does your iPhone, Google’s PageRank algorithm, and a butter
substitute called Smart Balance all have in common?

![](2017-09-12-patentsview-iphone.png)![](2017-09-12-patentsview-google.jpg)![](2017-09-12-patentsview-butter.png)

…They all probably wouldn’t be here if not for patents. A patent
provides its owner with the ability to make money off of something that
they invented, without having to worry about someone else copying their
technology. Think Apple would spend millions of dollars developing the
iPhone if Samsung could just come along and [rip it
off](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-samsung-elec-appeal-idUSKCN1271LF)?
Probably not.

**2. Patents offer a great opportunity for data analysis**

There are two primary reasons for this:

- **Patent data is public**. In return for the exclusive right to profit
  off an invention, an individual/company has to publicly disclose the
  details of their invention to the rest of the world. [Examples of
  those
  details](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?q=dog.ttl.&db=USPAT&type=queryString)
  include the patent’s title, abstract, technology classification,
  assigned organizations, etc.
- **Patent data can answer questions that people care about**. Companies
  (especially big ones like IBM and Google) have a vested interest in
  extracting insights from patents, and spend a lot of time/resources
  trying figure out how to best manage their intellectual property (IP)
  rights. They’re plagued by questions like “who should I sell my
  underperforming patents to,” “which technology areas are open to new
  innovations,” “what’s going to be the next big thing in the world of
  buttery spreads,” etc. Patents offer a way to provide data-driven
  answers to these questions.

Combined, these two things make patents a prime target for data
analysis. However, until recently it was hard to get at the data inside
these documents. One had to either collect it manually using the
official [United States Patent and Trademark
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office)
(USPTO) [search
engine](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/search/patent-public-search), or
figure out a way to download, parse, and model huge XML data dumps.
Enter PatentsView.

## PatentsView and the `patentsview` package

[PatentsView](https://datatool.patentsview.org/#viz/relationships) is
one of USPTO’s new initiatives intended to increase the usability and
value of patent data. One feature of this project is a publicly
accessible API that makes it easy to programmatically interact with the
data. A few of the reasons why I like the API (and PatentsView more
generally):

- An API key is now required (request one
  [here](https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals))
  and throttling is imposed (handled by the new version of the R
  package) at 45 requests per minute.
- The project offers [bulk downloads of patent
  data](https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables) on their
  website (in a flat file format), for those who want to be closest to
  the data.
- Both the API and the bulk download data contain disambiguated entities
  such as inventors, assignees, organizations, etc. In other words, the
  API will tell you whether it thinks that John Smith on patent X is the
  same person as John Smith on patent Y.[^1]

The `patentsview` R package is a wrapper around the PatentsView API. It
contains a function that acts as a client to the API
([`search_pv()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/search_pv.md))
as well as several supporting functions. Full documentation of the
package can be found on its
[website](https://ropensci.github.io/patentsview/index.html).

## Installation

You can get the stable version from CRAN:

``` r

install.packages("patentsview")
```

Or the latest build on from r-universe:

``` r

options(repos = c(
  patentsview = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/patentsview",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

install.packages("patentsview")
```

Or from GitHub:

``` r

if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
   devtools::install_github("ropensci/patentsview")
```

## Getting started

The package has one main function,
[`search_pv()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/search_pv.md),
that makes it easy to send requests to the API. There are two parameters
to
[`search_pv()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/search_pv.md)
that you’re going to want to think about just about every time you call
it - `query` and `fields`. You tell the API how you want to filter the
patent data with `query`, and which fields you want to retrieve with
`fields`.[^2]

### `query`

Your query has to use the [PatentsView query
language](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#api-query-language),
which is a JSON-based syntax that is similar to the one used by Lucene.
You can write the query directly and pass it as a string to
[`search_pv()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/search_pv.md):

``` r

library(patentsview)

qry_1 <- '{"_gt":{"patent_year":2014}}'
search_pv(query = qry_1, fields = NULL) # This will retrieve a default set of fields
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 3,857,653
```

…Or you can use the domain specific language (DSL) provided in the
`patentsview` package to help you write the query:

``` r

qry_2 <- qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2014) # All DSL functions are in the qry_funs list
qry_2 # qry_2 is the same as qry_1
#> {"_gt":{"patent_year":2014}}

search_pv(query = qry_2)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 3,857,653
```

`qry_1` and `qry_2` will result in the same HTTP call to the API. Both
queries search for patents in USPTO that were published after 2014.
There are three gotchas to look out for when writing a query:

1.  **All Fields are now queryable.** The API has 23 endpoints (the
    default endpoint is “patent”), and each endpoint has its own set of
    fields that you can filter on.
2.  **Correct data type for field.** If you’re filtering on a field in
    your query, you have to make sure that the value you are filtering
    on is consistent with the field’s data type. For example,
    `patent_year` has type “integer,” so if you pass 2014 as a string
    then you’re going to get an error (`patent_year = 2014` is good,
    `patent_year = "2014"` is no good). You can find a field’s data type
    in the `fieldsdf` data frame.
3.  **Comparison function works with field’s data type.** The comparison
    function(s) that you use (e.g., the greater-than function shown
    above, `qry_funs$gt()`) must be consistent with the field’s data
    type. For example, you can’t use the “contains” function on fields
    of type “integer” (`qry_funs$contains(patent_year = 2014)` will
    throw an error). See
    [`?qry_funs`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/qry_funs.md)
    for more details.

In short, use the `fieldsdf` data frame when you write a query and you
should be fine. Check out the [writing queries
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/writing-queries.md)
for more details.

### `fields`

Up until now we have been using the default value for `fields`. This
results in the API giving us some small set of default fields. Let’s see
about retrieving some more fields:

With the original verison of the API, we requested
patent_average_processing_time and inventor_total_num_patents. These
fields are no longer available from the patent endpoint.

``` r

search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2014),
  fields = c("patent_abstract", "inventors.inventor_name_first")
)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame (with list column(s) inside) on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  3 variables:
#>   ..$ patent_id      : chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#>   ..$ patent_abstract: chr [1:1000] "A frequency modulated (coherent) laser d"..
#>   ..$ inventors      :List of 1000
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 3,857,653
```

The fields that you can retrieve depends on the endpoint that you are
hitting. We’ve been using the “patent” endpoint thus far, so all of
these are retrievable:
`fieldsdf[fieldsdf$endpoint == "patent", "field"]`. You can also use
[`get_fields()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/get_fields.md)
to list the retrievable fields for a given endpoint, optionally limited
to specific groups of nested or top level fields

``` r

search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$gt(patent_year = 2014),
  fields = get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups = c("patents", "inventors"))
)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame (with list column(s) inside) on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  21 variables:
#>   ..$ patent_id                                                   : chr [1:10"..
#>   ..$ patent_title                                                : chr [1:10"..

```

## Example

Let’s look at a quick example of pulling and analyzing patent data.
We’ll look at patents from the last ten years that are classified below
the [H04L63/00 CPC
code](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification#!/CPC=H04L63/02).
Patents in this area relate to “network architectures or network
communication protocols for separating internal from external
traffic.”[^3] CPC codes offer a quick and dirty way to find patents of
interest, though getting a sense of their hierarchy can be tricky.

1.  Download the data

The original blog’s query is not possible in the new version of the API,
assignee_longitude and assignee_latitude are no longer returned by the
patent endpoint. Here we’ll use a different endpoint and a slightly
different query to get latitudes and longitudes to plot. Now we’ll query
the assignee endpoint for non-empty assignee_organization name, where
their assignee_individual_name_first and assignee_individual_name_last
would be empty (query where the assignee is an entity, not an
individual). The sort will be by assignee_num_patents descending so
we’ll get a list of the most prolific assignee_organizations

``` r

library(patentsview)

query <- with_qfuns( # with_qfuns is basically just: with(qry_funs, ...)
  neq("assignee_organization" = "")
)

# Create a list of fields:
# We request the fields we will use below rather than requesting them all and 
# then filtering to get just the ones we want
fields <- c("assignee_id", "assignee_organization", "assignee_num_patents",
   "assignee_lastknown_latitude", "assignee_lastknown_longitude")

# Send HTTP request to API's server:
pv_res <- search_pv(endpoint = "assignee", query = query, fields = fields, 
   sort = c("assignee_num_patents" = "desc"), all_pages = FALSE)
```

2.  See where the assignees are coming from (geographically)

``` r

library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

# My mom was an English teacher, so below we singularize/pluralize Patents
# or maybe Patents:1 was ok?  Here, because of the sort, it will be unlikely
# that there will be a single patent in our results.

data <-
  pv_res$data$assignees %>%
  mutate(popup = paste0(
    "<font color='Black'>",
    htmlEscape(assignee_organization), "<br><br>Patent",
    ifelse(assignee_num_patents == 1, ":", "s:"), # singular/plural
    assignee_num_patents, "</font>"
  )) %>%
  filter_at(vars(assignee_lastknown_latitude, assignee_lastknown_longitude), any_vars(!is.na(.))) # seeing NA lats and longs

leaflet(data) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatterNoLabels) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~assignee_lastknown_longitude, lat = ~assignee_lastknown_latitude,
    popup = ~popup, radius=2, color = "yellow"
  )
```

3.  Plot the growth of the field’s topics over time

``` r

library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Here we issue the original post's query, rewritten for the new version of the API
# (note the field name change as well as it being nested inside the cpc_current object)
# Oh, and we bumped the patent_year to give us data for the last ten years
query <- with_qfuns( # with_qfuns is basically just: with(qry_funs, ...)
  and(
    begins(cpc_current.cpc_group_id = "H04L63/02"),
    gte(patent_year = 2014)
  )
)

# Create a list of fields:
fields <- c(
  c("patent_id", "patent_year"),
  get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups = c("assignees", "cpc_current"))
)

pv_res <- search_pv(query = query, fields = fields, all_pages = TRUE)

# In the new version of the API, we don't get the CPC title back from the patent endpoint
# we have to call, you guessed it, the cpc_group endpoint now
qry <- qry_funs$begins(cpc_group_id = "H04L63/02")
qry
#> {"_begins":{"cpc_group_id":"H04L63/02"}}

cpc_info <- search_pv(query = qry, fields = get_fields("cpc_group"), endpoint = "cpc_group")

# More API craziness, in the HATEOAS link from the patent endpoint, the separator is
# inexplicably a colon.  In the data that comes back from the cpc_group endpoint, the
# separator is, get this, a slash like it should be.  All that to say that joining
# becomes a bit problematic or an exercise that makes dplyr wonder what we're up to.

data <-
  pv_res$data$patents %>%
  unnest(cpc_current) %>%
  mutate(cpc_group = sub(".*/([\\w:]+)/$", "\\1", cpc_group, perl = TRUE)) %>% # unHATEOAS cpc_group, funky colon and all
  filter(cpc_group != "H04L63:02") %>% # remove patents categorized into only top-level category of H04L63/02
  mutate(cpc_group = sub(":", "/", cpc_group)) %>% # back to normality, ahead of a join
  inner_join(cpc_info$data$cpc_groups, by = "cpc_group_id") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    title = case_when(
      grepl("filtering", .$cpc_group_title, ignore.case = T) ~
        "Filtering policies",
      .$cpc_group %in% c("H04L63/0209", "H04L63/0218") ~
        "Architectural arrangements",
      grepl("Firewall traversal", .$cpc_group_title, ignore.case = T) ~
        "Firewall traversal",
      TRUE ~
        .$cpc_group_title
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(title = gsub(".*(?=-)-", "", title, perl = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(title, patent_year) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()

max_year <- max(data$patent_year)
y_limit <- max(data$n) + 100 - (max(data$n) %% 100) # even hundred past the max

ggplot(data = data) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = patent_year, y = n, colour = title), se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous("\nGrant year",
    limits = c(2014, max_year),
    breaks = 2014:max_year
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous("Patents\n", limits = c(0, y_limit)) +
  scale_colour_manual("", values = brewer.pal(5, "Set2")) +
  theme_bw() + # theme inspired by https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

## Acknowledgments from the Original Blog Post

I’d like to thank the package’s two reviewers, [Paul
Oldham](https://github.com/poldham) and [Verena
Haunschmid](http://blog.haunschmid.name/), for taking the time to review
the package and providing helpful feedback. I’d also like to thank
[Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/) for shepherding the package
along the rOpenSci review process, as well [Scott
Chamberlain](https://scottchamberlain.info/) and [Stefanie
Butland](https://twitter.com/stefaniebutland) for their miscellaneous
help.

[^1]: This is both good and bad, as there are errors in the
    disambiguation. The algorithm that is responsible for the
    disambiguation was created by the winner of the [PatentsView
    Inventor Disambiguation Technical
    Workshop](http://www.patentsview.org/workshop/).

[^2]: These two parameters end up getting translated into a
    Elasticsearch query by the API’s server, which then gets sent to a
    back-end database. `query` and `fields` are used to create the
    query’s `WHERE` and `SELECT` clauses, respectively.

[^3]: There is a slightly more in-depth definition that says that these
    are patents “related to the (logical) separation of traffic/(sub-)
    networks to achieve protection.”
