# Converting an Existing Script

If you have a script that worked with the original R package and
original version of the API, chances are it will need some possibly
substantial changes before it will work with the new version of the R
package and API.

## Required API Key

First off you’ll need to [request an API
key](https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
and then set the environmental variable PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY to the value
of your API key. Ex. set PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY=My_api_key Without a valid
API key, all your calls will be rejected by the API.

## The New Throttling Limit

Another new thing is a throttling limit. The new version of the API only
allows an individual API key to make 45 calls per minute. The call that
exceeds that limit is rejected but does return the number of seconds to
wait before calls would be allowed again. Fortunately, the R package
handles this for you! Your script will be chugging along and if the API
should return a throttling response, the R package will sleep for the
required number of seconds before automatically resending your query!
The only thing you may notice, besides a warning message, it that the
script will pause when throttled before it picks right back up again.

## Philosophical Change

The new version of the API’s endpoints are less Swiss Army Knife-like
than before, where you could get nearly any data field from any
endpoint. Now they have substantially lighter responses and they
generally focus on data pertinent to that endpoint. In other words, you
can only get USPC fields from the USPC endpoints or from the patent
endpoint. This may mean you’ll have to make multiple calls to different
endpoints to get the same data the old version of API used to return in
a single call.

Take a look at the [top assignees
application](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/top-assignees.md).
It has to blend together information from separate calls that used to be
returned by a single call. This may push your dplyr skills to the limit.

## Changed Field Names and Types

The fields requested by the original script or used in its query may not
be available from the new version’s endpoints. The nber attributes are
no longer available as the nber_subcategories endpoint was removed.
Also, some attributes have new names, like name_last in the nested
inventor object returned by the patent endpoint. Now in the fields
parameter it would be specified as “inventor.name_last” where formerly
it was “inventor_last_name” when using the patent endpoint. This also
demonstrates how nested fields need to be fully qualified in the query
parameter.

Also note that some field’s types have changed, meaning you’ll need to
use different operators within your query. Ex. assignee.organization is
now a full text field, formerly it was a string.

``` r


library(patentsview)

# Before you could do a 
qry_funs$contains(assignee_organization="Rice University")
#> {"_contains":{"assignee_organization":"Rice University"}}

# now you would have to do 
qry_funs$text_phrase(assignees.assignee_organization="Rice University")
#> {"_text_phrase":{"assignees.assignee_organization":"Rice University"}}
```

Checkout the [API
documentation](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#endpoints)
and the [Swagger UI page](https://search.patentsview.org/swagger-ui/) to
see the returned fields and their types. The same information is
available in the `fieldsdf` data frame but it is harder to read.

## Singular Endpoints

The endpoints are now singular, ex: “patent” where previously it was
“patents”.

``` r

get_endpoints()
#>  [1] "assignee"                       "cpc_class"                     
#>  [3] "cpc_group"                      "cpc_subclass"                  
#>  [5] "g_brf_sum_text"                 "g_claim"                       
#>  [7] "g_detail_desc_text"             "g_draw_desc_text"              
#>  [9] "inventor"                       "ipc"                           
#> [11] "location"                       "patent"                        
#> [13] "patent/attorney"                "patent/foreign_citation"       
#> [15] "patent/other_reference"         "patent/rel_app_text"           
#> [17] "patent/us_application_citation" "patent/us_patent_citation"     
#> [19] "pg_brf_sum_text"                "pg_claim"                      
#> [21] "pg_detail_desc_text"            "pg_draw_desc_text"             
#> [23] "publication"                    "publication/rel_app_text"      
#> [25] "uspc_mainclass"                 "uspc_subclass"                 
#> [27] "wipo"
```

## Additions to the R Package

Some of the endpoints now return HATEOAS links, where you make a call
back to the API to retrieve additional data. The new method
retrieve_linked_data() does just that.  
There is a lot more about this
[here](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/api-changes.html#hateoas-links).

## Conclusion

So there you have it, our attempt at listing what’s changed and what to
do about it.
[Request](https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
an API key and get going with the new version of the R package! The two
API versions will coexist for a while but the API team plans to shutdown
the original version of the API in February 2025.
