# API Changes

In July of 2021 the Patentsview API team announced [upcoming API
changes](https://patentsview.org/data-in-action/whats-new-patentsview-july-2021).
This page will explain the necessary changes and additions to the R
package. Note that these are **breaking changes**, existing scripts will
no longer run as-is using the the new version of the R package which
uses the new version of the API. As noted below, the new version of the
R package handles some of the changes for users.

One change to note, the API team changed the name of the API.
PatentsView’s Search API is now the PatentSearch API, as announced
[here](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/#naming-update). The R
package will retain its name, continue to use
[`library(patentsview)`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/index.html)
as before.

## Summary of Pertinent API Changes

Listed here are the API changes that matter to users of the original
version of the R package (which used the original version of the API).
Toward the bottom of this page are additional API changes what would
only matter if you called the API directly or wanted to write a python
library for the API.

- The original version of the API was shut down in early 2025. The
  original version of the R package no longer works.

- An [API key](#api-key-required) is now required.

- All fields can be queried now and there is seemingly [no
  distinction](#operators) between using string and full text operators
  now, with a new [case sensitivity caveat](#case-sensitivity-caveat)
  though. Note that now some fields are returned in nested objects and
  would need to be fully qualified in the query parameter. Ex.
  `search_pv(qry_funs$begins(cpc_current.cpc_group_id="A01B1/00"))`

  In the fields parameter, nested fields can be fully qualified or a new
  API shorthand can be used, where group names can specified. When group
  names are used, all of the group’s nested fields will be returned by
  the API. Ex. the new version of the API and R package will accept
  fields=c(“assignees”) when using the patent endpoint and all nested
  assignees fields will be returned by the API. This would be similar to
  `get_fields("patent", groups=c("assignees"))` except that it’s the API
  deciding what fields to return (in this case, all of the assignees
  fields).

- A result set’s size seems unbounded now, you can now retrieve more
  than 100,000 rows. You’d need to be careful when setting all_pages =
  TRUE as the R package will page until the entire result set is
  retrieved which could be a million or more rows. Note that in the
  previous version of the API total_hits was capped at 100,000 rows.

``` r

library(patentsview)
search_pv('{"patent_type":"utility"}', all_pages = FALSE)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 8,343,075
```

Also note that we did not specify the fields parameter. In the past the
API returned a default set of parameters for each endpoint. For the
patent endpoint that was patent_id, patent_title and patent_date. Now
the R package requests only the endpoint’s primary key(s) when the user
does not specify fields.

- Endpoint Changes

  - nber_subcategories went away- it was an endpoint in the original
    version of the API
  - Endpoints are now singular, ex. patent not patents. The returned
    entities are still plural for the most part.
  - Now there are [27 endpoints](#endpoints), up from the original 7  

- Comparison of the old and new attributes that can be sent to the API
  in its o: (options) parameter via search_pv(). Note that the old
  parameters are now deprecated.

  | Original API | New Version | Purpose |
  |----|----|----|
  | per_page (max 10,000) | size (max 1,000) | maximum number of rows to return on each request |
  | page | after | page through large result sets |
  | subent_cnts |  | whether the query results should include the total counts of unique subentities |
  | mtchd_subent_only |  | whether a query should return all related subentities or just those that match query criteria. |

## Additional R Package Changes 

- The R package changed internally from using httr to httr2. This only
  affects users if they passed additional arguments (…) to search_pv().
  Previously if they passed config = httr::timeout(40) they’d now pass
  timeout = 40 (name-value pairs of valid curl options, as found in
  curl::curl_options() see
  [req_options](https://httr2.r-lib.org/reference/req_options.html))

- Now that the R package is using httr2, users can make use of its
  last_request() method to see what was sent to the API. This could be
  useful when trying to fix an invalid request. Also fun would be seeing
  the raw API response. The R package sets the after parameter and
  changes the sort sent to the API, so viewing the last_request() after
  calling search_pv with all_pages = TRUE might not be what you’d
  expect. There is more about this
  [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/result-set-paging.md).

&nbsp;

    httr2::last_request()
    httr2::last_response()
    httr2::last_response() |> httr2::resp_body_json() 

- A new method was added

  - HATEOAS links can be retrieved using
    [retrieve_linked_data()](#HATEOAS)

- An existing function was removed. With the API changes, there is less
  of a need for cast_pv_data() which was previously part of the R
  package. The API now returns most fields as appropriate types,
  boolean, numeric etc., instead of always returning strings.

- The ropensci blog post that announced the original version of the R
  package was
  [reworked](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/ropensci-blog-post.md)
  to use the new version of the R package and API

- If the fields parameter on search_pv() isn’t specified, the R package
  will default to them to the primary key(s) for that endpoint.
  Previously no fields were specified and the API’s default fields were
  returned.

## Swagger UI Page 

The Patentsview API team has provided a Swagger UI page for the new
version of the API at <https://search.patentsview.org/swagger-ui/>. How
cool is that? Think of it as an online version of Postman already loaded
with the API’s endpoints and returns. Each field listed in the 200
response sections could be requested in the fields parameter and each
field is supposed to be queryable (usable in the query parameter). The
Swagger UI page can be used to make requests, if you have an API key to
enter in the authorization screen. The Swagger UI definition at
<https://search.patentsview.org/static/openapi.json> can be imported
into Postman to give you a nicely loaded collection for the new version
of the API. You’ll just need to set a global variable PVIEW_KEY and set
the authorization’s value to {{PVIEW_KEY}} to your API key.

## Details of the API changes

### An API Key is required 

Perhaps the most important change, without an API key your queries will
be rejected. Request an API key using this link:
<https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals>
Once you have one, you’ll need to set an environmental variable
PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY to the value of your API key for the R package to
use.

The user’s API key needs to be sent on all requests

    api_key = Sys.getenv("PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY")
    httr2::req_headers("X-Api-Key" = api_key, .redact = "X-Api-Key")

### Endpoints 

Now there are 27 endpoints, up from the original 7, and each returns a
smaller, more specific data structure pertinent to that endpoint. As an
example, previously the inventor endpoint could return assignee
information, it no longer does that. The exception is the patent
endpoint. It now can return assignees, inventors, cpc_current along with
patent specific fields. Note that some new endpoints are nested under
patent/ and one is under publication/

1.  There are 19 totally new endpoints
    - /api/v1/g_brf_sum_text/
    - /api/v1/g_claim/
    - /api/v1/g_detail_desc_text/
    - /api/v1/g_draw_desc_text/
    - /api/v1/pg_brf_sum_text/
    - /api/v1/pg_claim/
    - /api/v1/pg_detail_desc_text/
    - /api/v1/pg_draw_desc_text/
    - /api/v1/ipc/
    - /api/v1/uspc_subclass/
    - /api/v1/patent/attorney/
    - /api/v1/patent/foreign_citation/
    - /api/v1/patent/otherreference/
    - /api/v1/patent/rel_app_text/
    - /api/v1/patent/us_application_citation/
    - /api/v1/patent/us_patent_citation/
    - /api/v1/publication/rel_app_text/
    - /api/v1/publications/
    - /api/v1/wipo/
2.  Five of the original API’s endpoints now have singular names but
    lighter responses and fewer queryable fields as mentioned above.
    - /api/v1/assignee/
    - /api/v1/inventor/
    - /api/v1/location/
    - /api/v1/patent/
    - /api/v1/uspc_mainclass/
3.  The original CPC endpoint has a new name and there are two new CPC
    endpoints
    - /api/v1/cpc_class/
    - /api/v1/cpc_subclass/
    - /api/v1/cpc_group/
4.  The nber_subcategory endpoint seems to be gone now.

#### Things to note 

1.  Currently some endpoints do not return all the attributes listed in
    the API’s OpenAPI object. Some throw 500 errors when requested[^1]
    (see test-api-bugs.R)

2.  There are two rel_app_text endpoints, one under patent/ and one
    under publication/ They both return entities named rel_app_texts but
    they are slightly different, patent_id in the former and
    document_number in the latter. The only other field in both is
    related_text.

3.  Some endpoints now return [HATEOAS links](#HATEOAS)

4.  Some fields went away, like rawinventor_first_name and
    rawinventor_last_name, and some have new names, most significantly,
    patent_number is now patent_id. Requesting patent_number will result
    in an error being thrown. Note also that the CPC related fields have
    new names, see the next section.

5.  On the [Swagger UI page](https://search.patentsview.org/swagger-ui/)
    before the 2024-10-06 API release, there was a link to a
    [TextEndpointStatus](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/TextEndpointStatus)
    showing what years were populated at the Patent Text endpoints (the
    ones starting with g\_ and pg\_).

    It’s unclear if the TextEndpointStatus page will be updated on each
    data release, so we’ll check one pair for ourselves. patent_date
    isn’t available from g_brf_sum_text so we’ll ask the patent endpoint
    for it once we have the smallest patent_id from g_brf_sum_text.

    ``` r

    qry <- qry_funs$ne(patent_id = "")
    sort <- c(patent_id = "asc")
    grant <- search_pv(qry, sort = sort, endpoint = "g_brf_sum_text", size = 1)

    fields <- c("patent_id", "patent_title", "patent_date")
    res <- search_pv(qry_funs$eq(patent_id = grant$data$g_brf_sum_texts$patent_id), 
      fields = fields, size = 1)

    res$data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
    #> 
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1 obs. of  3 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_id   : chr "11212952"
    #>   ..$ patent_title: chr "Drive over mower deck automatic locking mechanism"
    #>   ..$ patent_date : chr "2022-01-04"
    ```

    ``` r

    qry <- qry_funs$ne(document_number = "")
    sort <- c("document_number" = "asc")
    pre_grant <- search_pv(qry, sort = sort, endpoint = "pg_brf_sum_text",
      fields = get_fields("pg_brf_sum_text"), size = 1)

    pre_grant$data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame on pg_brf_sum_texts level:
    #> 
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ pg_brf_sum_texts:'data.frame':    1 obs. of  2 variables:
    #>   ..$ document_number: num 20220312660
    #>   ..$ summary_text   : chr "FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention r"..
    ```

    So, at the time this vignette was generated, both endpoints appear
    to have data going back to 2022. Note that the current year may not
    be populated yet.

    ``` r

    qry <- qry_funs$ne(patent_id = "")
    sort <- c(patent_id = "desc")  # here we flip the sort
    grant <- search_pv(qry, sort = sort, endpoint = "g_brf_sum_text", size = 1)

    fields <- c("patent_id", "patent_title", "patent_date")
    res <- search_pv(qry_funs$eq(patent_id = grant$data$g_brf_sum_texts$patent_id), 
      fields = fields, size = 1)
    res$data
    #> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
    #> 
    #> List of 1
    #>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1 obs. of  3 variables:
    #>   ..$ patent_id   : chr "RE50471"
    #>   ..$ patent_title: chr "Semiconductor device and method for manufacturing th"..
    #>   ..$ patent_date : chr "2025-06-24"
    ```

### HATEOAS Links 

Some of the returned fields are HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of
Application State) links to retrieve more information about that field.
Slightly funky is the cpc_current’s cpc_group, returned by the patent
endpoint. Here the slash in the CPC is turned into a colon. This is a
peculiarity of two of the new convenience URLs (new endpoints that
accept a single URL parameter) that shouldn’t be noticeable in the R
package, unless you are trying to infer the USPC and CPC values from the
returned URLs, without actually calling back for this data. See
[`retrieve_linked_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/reference/retrieve_linked_data.md)

Here we’ll call the patent endpoint to get CPC fields for a particular
patent, some of the returned fields, like the cpc_group, are HATEOAS
links:

``` r


  query <- '{"patent_id": "11530080"}'
  fields <- get_fields('patent', groups = 'cpc_current')
  fields <- c("patent_id", fields)
  fields
#>  [1] "patent_id"                   "cpc_current.cpc_class"      
#>  [3] "cpc_current.cpc_class_id"    "cpc_current.cpc_group"      
#>  [5] "cpc_current.cpc_group_id"    "cpc_current.cpc_section"    
#>  [7] "cpc_current.cpc_sequence"    "cpc_current.cpc_subclass"   
#>  [9] "cpc_current.cpc_subclass_id" "cpc_current.cpc_type"

  result <- search_pv(query, fields=fields)

  # As noted above, the CPC related fields aren't the same as they were in the
  # original version of the API.  Also note that not all requested fields were
  # returned and that _id-less, HATEOAS fields were returned.
  unnested <- unnest_pv_data(result$data)
  z <- lapply(names(unnested$cpc_current), function(x) {
     print(paste0(x,': ', unnested$cpc_current[[x]][[1]]))
  })
#> [1] "patent_id: 11530080"
#> [1] "cpc_sequence: 0"
#> [1] "cpc_class: https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/cpc_class/B65/"
#> [1] "cpc_class_id: B65"
#> [1] "cpc_subclass: https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/cpc_subclass/B65D/"
#> [1] "cpc_subclass_id: B65D"
#> [1] "cpc_group: https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/cpc_group/B65D71:0033/"
#> [1] "cpc_group_id: B65D71/0033"
```

Note that going to these links in a browser will result in a 403
Unauthorized, as no API key is sent. Also note the last two lines of
output, `"cpc_group_id: B65D71/0033"` (normal/expected) and
`"cpc_group: https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/cpc_group/B65D71:0033/"`
(slightly odd use of a colon).

There is a new method in the R package to retrieve data from the HATEOAS
links, just pass the returned link and the R package will retrieve the
data for you.

``` r


library(patentsview)

pv_data <- retrieve_linked_data("https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/cpc_group/G01S7:4865/")
str(pv_data$data)
#> List of 1
#>  $ cpc_groups:'data.frame':  1 obs. of  6 variables:
#>   ..$ cpc_group_id   : chr "G01S7/4865"
#>   ..$ cpc_group_title: chr "Details of systems according to groups G01S13/00, G01S15/00, G01S17/00-of systems according to group G01S17/00-"| __truncated__
#>   ..$ cpc_class_id   : chr "G01"
#>   ..$ cpc_class      : chr "https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/cpc_class/G01/"
#>   ..$ cpc_subclass_id: chr "G01S"
#>   ..$ cpc_subclass   : chr "https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/cpc_subclass/G01S/"
#>  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "list" "pv_data_result"
```

Note that when calling the cpc_group endpoint instead of using the
HATEOAS link, you’d use a slash instead of a colon.

``` r


result <- search_pv('{"cpc_group_id": "A01B1/00"}', endpoint = 'cpc_group')
str(result$data)
#> List of 1
#>  $ cpc_groups:'data.frame':  1 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ cpc_group_id: chr "A01B1/00"
#>  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "list" "pv_data_result"
```

Slight weirdness/sleight-of-hand where the returned field name loses the
\_id of the requested field

``` r

  # We'll make a call to the patent endpoint to get inventor and assignee HATEOAS links
  res <- search_pv('{"patent_id":"10000000"}',
    fields = c("inventors.inventor_id", "assignees.assignee_id")
  )

  # in the nested "assignees" object is "assignee", the HATEOAS link for the assignee and
  # "assignee_id", just the id 
  print(res$data$patents$assignees[[1]]$assignee)
#> [1] "https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/assignee/6a176a1e-eb7d-4baf-902e-0e37183742d7/"
  print(res$data$patents$assignees[[1]]$assignee_id)
#> [1] "6a176a1e-eb7d-4baf-902e-0e37183742d7"

  # there are similar fields in the nested "inventors" object
  print(res$data$patents$inventors[[1]]$inventor) 
#> [1] "https://search.patentsview.org:80/api/v1/inventor/fl:jo_ln:marron-5/"
  print(res$data$patents$inventors[[1]]$inventor_id)
#> [1] "fl:jo_ln:marron-5"
```

### API Throttling 

The API will now allow 45 requests per minute, making more requests will
anger the API. It will send back an error code with a header indicating
how many seconds to wait before sending more queries. The R package will
take care of this for you. It will sleep for the required number of
seconds before resubmitting your query, seamlessly to your script.

### A Note on Paging 

The API team changed [how paging
works](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#pagination)
and there is an important subtlety that the R package handles for you.
This screams for a python library so python users don’t need to worry
about this and throttling! See the new [Result Set Paging
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/result-set-paging.md).

### String and Full Text Operators 

The Tip below “Syntax” in the API’s
[documentation](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#syntax)
says:

> When working with text data fields, wherever possible, we recommend
> using \_text\* operators over the \_contains and \_begins operator.
> The text operators treat these fields as full text data and hence are
> more performant. The “full text” fields are identified in the API
> Endpoint specification with the value “text” for the data type.

Not sure if that only applies to the Patent Text and Publication Text
endpoints (listed at the top of the [Swagger UI
page](https://search.patentsview.org/swagger-ui/)) or not. Also not sure
what to make of the result set size differences[^2], total_hits, noting
that no errors were thrown by the API:

hitting the patent endpoint:

``` r

query1 <- '{"_contains":{"patent_title":"dog"}}'
query2 <- '{"_text_any":{"patent_title":"dog"}}'

search_pv(query1)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10000747" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 3,864

search_pv(query2)
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10028486" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 2,244
```

hitting the g_brf_sum_text endpoint:

``` r

query1 <- '{"_contains":{"summary_text":"particular depth"}}'
query2 <- '{"_text_phrase":{"summary_text":"particular depth"}}'

search_pv(query1, endpoint="g_brf_sum_text")
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on g_brf_sum_texts level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ g_brf_sum_texts: list()
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 0

search_pv(query2, endpoint="g_brf_sum_text")
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on g_brf_sum_texts level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ g_brf_sum_texts:'data.frame': 162 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:162] "11226588" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 162
```

### Case Sensitivity Caveat 

The original version of the API seemed to be case insensitive. Not sure
if this is a bug or feature[^3] in the new version of the API but it’s
something to be aware of.

As you’ll see from the queries below, the two forms of equal now seem to
be case sensitive.

``` r

library(patentsview)

organization <- "Johnson & Johnson International"

# explicit equal
eq_query <- qry_funs$eq(assignee_organization = organization)
eq_query
#> {"_eq":{"assignee_organization":"Johnson & Johnson International"}}
result <- search_pv(eq_query, endpoint="assignee")
print (result$query_results$total_hits)
#> [1] 1

# implied equal
implied_eq_query <- paste0('{"assignee_organization": "', organization, '"}')
cat(implied_eq_query)
#> {"assignee_organization": "Johnson & Johnson International"}
result <- search_pv(implied_eq_query, endpoint="assignee")
print (result$query_results$total_hits)
#> [1] 1

organization <- tolower(organization)

eq_query <- qry_funs$eq(assignee_organization = organization)
eq_query
#> {"_eq":{"assignee_organization":"johnson & johnson international"}}
result <- search_pv(eq_query, endpoint="assignee")
print (result$query_results$total_hits)
#> [1] 0

implied_eq_query <- paste0('{"assignee_organization": "', organization, '"}')
cat(implied_eq_query)
#> {"assignee_organization": "johnson & johnson international"}
result <- search_pv(implied_eq_query, endpoint="assignee")
print (result$query_results$total_hits)
#> [1] 0

# text_phrase seems to be case insensitive but equal is not
text_query <- with_qfuns(text_phrase(assignee_organization = organization))
text_query
#> {"_text_phrase":{"assignee_organization":"johnson & johnson international"}}
result <- search_pv(text_query, endpoint = "assignee")
print (result$query_results$total_hits)
#> [1] 1
```
